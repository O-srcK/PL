This roadmap details the types of questions found in past exams from "all tests.pdf," prioritizing the most recent sessions (2022 and 2023), and outlines the essential topics required to solve them. As requested, all content related to Temporal Logic (Kripke structures, LTL, CTL) and Hoare Logic has been excluded.

### **1. Finite Automata and Regular Languages**
Questions in this category focus on the identification, transformation, and properties of regular languages.

    *   **Distinguishability:** Identifying which pairs of states in a given DFA are distinguishable.
    *   **Language Recognition:** Determining if a described language (e.g., "all words of even length") is regular or matches a specific automaton.
    *   **Closure Properties:** Identifying which operations (union, intersection, complement) preserve regularity.
    *   **Pumping Lemma:** Identifying the correct proof sketch or strategy to use the Pumping Lemma to prove a language is not regular.

### **2. Context-Free Languages (CFLs)**
Exam questions here test the ability to parse strings and understand the limits of push-down automata.

*   **Question Types:**
    *   **PDA Word Acceptance:** Determining if specific words are accepted by a given Push-Down Automaton (by final state or empty stack).
    *   **CYK Parsing:** Filling in matrix entries for the CYK algorithm or counting occurrences of specific non-terminals in the resulting table.
    *   **Chomsky Normal Form (CNF):** Identifying which grammar rules are valid in CNF or converting a grammar to CNF.
    *   **Ambiguity:** Concluding the properties of an ambiguous grammar (e.g., existence of multiple derivation trees for a single word).
    *   **Closure and Hierarchies:** Identifying which languages are context-free and their relationship to regular languages (e.g., $Regular \subset Context-Free$).

### **4. Undecidability and Reductions**
This section is highly prioritized in recent exams, focusing on proving that certain problems have no algorithmic solution.

*   **Question Types:**
    *   **Rice’s Theorem:** Identifying which properties of TM languages are undecidable by applying Rice's conditions (non-triviality and property of the language).
    *   **Decidability of Logic:** Identifying whether provability or validity is decidable for Propositional Logic, Predicate Logic, or Peano Arithmetic.
    *   **Problem Reductions:** Identifying which problem reduction is achieved by a given function $F(M, w)$ (e.g., reducing the Halting problem to the Blank Tape Acceptance problem).
    *   **Undecidable CFG Problems:** Identifying undecidable questions about CFGs, such as whether $L(G_1) \cap L(G_2) = \emptyset$ or $L(G) = \Sigma^*$.

*   **Required Topics:**
    *   **Diagonalization** and the Halting Problem.
    *   **Mapping Reductions ($A \le_m B$)**: Using one problem to prove the undecidability of another.
    *   **Rice’s Theorem**: Any non-trivial property of the *language* recognized by a TM is undecidable.
    *   **Gödel’s Incompleteness Theorems**: Arithmetic can express its own undecidability.

### **5. Propositional and Predicate Logic**
Recent exams heavily feature formal proofs and semantic checks for these logical systems.

*   **Question Types:**
    *   **Truth Tables and Satisfiability:** Calculating truth tables or determining if a propositional formula is a tautology, satisfiable, or a contradiction.
    *   **Natural Deduction (Propositional):** Identifying the specific rules used in a given "Box Proof" (e.g., $\to i$, $\neg e$, PBC).
    *   **Predicate Logic Semantics:** Determining if a formula holds in a specific model (universe + relations) provided as a diagram or set.
    *   **Predicate Logic Rules:** Identifying valid applications of quantifier rules like Universal Elimination $(\forall e)$ or Existential Introduction $(\exists i)$.
